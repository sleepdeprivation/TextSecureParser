# TextSecureParser
Parses xml files generated by the backup option in Signal (formerly TextSecure)


File format of these backups looks something like this:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes" ?>
<!-- File Created By Signal -->
<smses count="9000">
<sms protocol="0" address="+1234567890" date="1455250251192" type="1" subject="null" body="This is a text message" toa="null" sc_toa="null" service_center="null" read="1" status="-1" locked="0" />
...
```

We parse it into a `list` of `dict`s
